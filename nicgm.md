## Selection of Noninvasive Features in Wrist-Based Wearable Sensors to Predict Blood Glucose Concentrations Using Machine Learning Algorithms

**Project description:** Glucose monitoring technologies allow users to monitor glycemic fluctuations (e.g., blood glucose levels). This is particularly important for individuals who suffer from diabetes mellitus (DM). Traditional self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) devices require the user to prick their finger and extract a blood drop to measure the blood glucose based on chemical reactions with the blood. Unlike traditional glucometer devices, noninvasive continuous glucose monitoring (NICGM) devices aim to solve these issues by consistently monitoring users’ blood glucose levels (BGLs) without invasively acquiring a sample. In this work, we have investigated the feasibility of a novel approach to NICGM using multiple off-the-shelf wearable sensors and learning-based models (i.e., machine learning) to predict blood glucose. Two datasets were used for this study: (1) the Ohi-oT1DM dataset, provided by the Ohio University; and (2) the UofM dataset, created by our research team. The UofM dataset consists of fourteen features provided by six sensors for studying possible relationships between glucose and noninvasive biometric measurements. Both datasets are passed through a machine learning (ML) pipeline that tests linear and non-linear models to predict BGLs from the set of noninvasive features. The results of this pilot study show that the combination of fourteen noninvasive biometric measurements with ML algorithms could lead to accurate BGL predictions within the clinical range; however, a larger dataset is required to make conclusions about the feasibility of this approach.
