## Polarization-sensitive digital holographic microscopy using a Fresnel biprism

Project Description: 
The hallmark of digital holographic microscopy (DHM) is the ability to perform quantitative phase imaging (QPI) with speed, accuracy, high resolution, high temporal stability, and polarization sensitivity (PS). We have developed a DHM system based on a Fresnel biprism (FB) with the five above desired features. The system presented here provides accurate quantitative PS phase images and the reconstruction of real three-dimensional information in a simple, compact and cost-effective way. We have demonstrated the performance of our method experimentally by reconstructing quantitative calibrated phase images of standardized samples and of U87 human glioblastoma cells.
