## Global Stress Detection Framework Combining a Reduced Set of HRV Features and Random Forest Model

Project Description: 
Approximately 65% of the worldwide adult population has experienced stress, affecting their daily routine at least once in the past year. Stress becomes harmful when it occurs for too long or is continuous (i.e., chronic), interfering with our performance, attention, and concentration. Chronic high stress contributes to major health issues such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, depression, and anxiety. Several researchers have focused on detecting stress through combining many features with machine/deep learning models. Despite these efforts, our community has not agreed on the number of features to identify stress conditions using wearable devices. In addition, most of the reported studies have been focused on person-specific training and testing. Thanks to our community’s broad acceptance of wearable wristband devices, this work investigates a global stress detection model combining eight HRV features with a random forest (RF) algorithm. Whereas the model’s performance is evaluated for each individual, the training of the RF model contains instances of all subjects (i.e., global training). We have validated the proposed global stress model using two open-access databases (the WESAD and SWELL databases) and their combination. The eight HRV features with the highest classifying power are selected using the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) method, reducing the training time of the global stress platform. The proposed global stress monitoring model identifies person-specific stress events with an accuracy higher than 99% after a global training framework. Future work should be focused on testing this global stress monitoring framework in real-world applications.
